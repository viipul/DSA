Given an array, print the Next Smaller Element (NSE) for every element. The NSE for an element x is the first smaller element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no smaller element exist (on right side), consider NSE as -1. 
Examples: 
a) For any array, rightmost element always has NSE as -1. 
b) For an array which is sorted in increasing order, all elements have NSE as -1. 
c) For the input array [4, 8, 5, 2, 25}, the NSE for each element are as follows.

Element         NSE
   4      -->    2
   8      -->    5
   5      -->    2
   2      -->   -1
   25     -->   -1
d) For the input array [13, 7, 6, 12}, the next smaller elements for each element are as follows.  

  Element        NSE
   13      -->    7
   7       -->    6
   6       -->   -1
   12      -->   -1

      for i in range(1,n):

          next_element=arr[i]

          if len(marks_stack)==0:
              marks_stack.append(i)
              continue


          while len(marks_stack)>0 and next_element<arr[marks_stack[-1]]:

              ans[marks_stack[-1]]=next_element
              marks_stack.pop() 

          marks_stack.append(i)

      while len(marks_stack)>0:
          ans[marks_stack[-1]]=-1
          marks_stack.pop()
      final_ans=[]
      for i in range(n):
          final_ans.append(ans[i])
      return final_ans
